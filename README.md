# Keyboard_dummy

This repository serves as a playground to test my other crates regarding next word prediction and gesture recognition. It's a very simple GUI that looks similar to a keyboard but its actually just a screenshot of the buttons. It is as simple as possible to focus on the testing.


## TODO
- Height and width of the keyboard are not the same. Take that into account for gesture recognition
